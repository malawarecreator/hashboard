# hashboard

download a release and enjoy! Im on windows so i cant build for mac or linux, but if you do have a mac or linux computer and you wanna build it, just compile it and dm me on discord @biggyballz_69 and we'll work smth out.

## BTW
I had this issue too, the installed app is in `C:\Users\{YOUR_USERNAME}\AppData\Local\hashboard`
